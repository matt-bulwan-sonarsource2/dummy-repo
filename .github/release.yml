changelog:
  # This 'description' field is for the overall release notes generated by GitHub.
  # While not a 'template' that pre-fills the *entire* release description,
  # the generated section will be presented clearly to the release manager.
  # The configuration itself serves as a guide for what kind of changes to track.
  # Consider this file as part of your internal 'release documentation'.

  # Exclude specific labels or authors from appearing in the release notes.
  exclude:
    labels:
      - skip-for-release # Use this label for PRs not relevant to end-users (e.g., CI tweaks)
      - do-not-merge # PRs that should never be merged for a release
    authors:
      - dependabot[bot] # Typically don't need dependabot updates in main release notes
      - github-actions[bot] # Action updates are usually internal

  # Define categories for your release notes based on labels applied to pull requests.
  categories:
    - title: "✨ New Features & Enhancements" # Clear, positive title
      labels:
        - "feature"
        - "enhancement"
        - "feat" # Common convention for features (e.g., conventional commits)
      # This description might appear if 'template' is enabled in a future GitHub feature,
      # or implicitly guides the user to look for these types of changes.
      description: "Exciting new capabilities and significant improvements that users will notice."

    - title: "🐛 Bug Fixes" # Straightforward and expected
      labels:
        - "bug"
        - "fix" # Common convention for bug fixes
      description: "Critical fixes addressing issues reported by users or found internally."

    - title: "🚨 Breaking Changes" # Use a clear warning for breaking changes
      labels:
        - "breaking-change"
        - "major" # If you use labels to indicate major version bumps
      description: "⚠️ **ATTENTION:** These changes may require updates to your code or configuration. Please review carefully!"
      # This section implicitly tells the release manager:
      # 1. Be very careful with PRs tagged with 'breaking-change'.
      # 2. Ensure these are adequately documented in the PR itself.
      # 3. Consider if this warrants a MAJOR version bump (semantic versioning).

    - title: "🛠️ Refactors & Performance Improvements" # Important but less user-facing
      labels:
        - "refactor"
        - "performance"
        - "perf"
      description: "Under-the-hood improvements that boost efficiency or readability, often without direct user impact."

    - title: "📖 Documentation & Examples" # Essential for usability
      labels:
        - "documentation"
        - "docs"
        - "example"
      description: "Updates to our guides, API references, and code examples."

    - title: "📦 Dependency Updates & Housekeeping" # For transparency, especially for power users
      labels:
        - "dependencies"
        - "chore" # General maintenance tasks
        - "ci" # Continuous Integration related changes
      description: "Updates to internal libraries and maintenance tasks."
      collapsed: true # Often good to collapse less critical sections by default

# Optional: Configuration for the release description itself.
# As of my last update, GitHub's release.yml primarily influences the 'Generate release notes' button.
# For truly 'pre-filling' the entire release body, you typically need to rely on the
# manual process or a CI/CD pipeline that drafts the release via API.
# However, the existence of this file and its structure serves as the primary guidance.

# You can also add custom categories or sections here if your project has unique needs.
# For example, if you have specific security fixes, you might add a 'Security Vulnerabilities' category.
